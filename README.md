# Final Project
This is for the Putting it All Together Challenge for INFX 598 Beginning Web Development

This website gives a brief look at some photos from my time in Tanzania.  If you want to know more about this great country, I have provided a link to Wikipedia in the footer.  All photos belong to me.

I worked on this site by myself.
